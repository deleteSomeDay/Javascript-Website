            <p>EcommShare is about helping Ecommerce entrepreneurs to lift each other up. Having started a T-Shirt ecommerce site over a year ago, I have noticed that there is a
                hole between creating our own products and dropshipping. This site aims to help us fill that gap by boosting each other's sales and brand awareness through sharing 
                our products across sites. We hope to connect Ecommerce sites of similar ilk in order to create new opportunities
